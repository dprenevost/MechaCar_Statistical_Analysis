* In the above image, you can see 3 highlighted coefficents that provide non-random variance to the MPG values in the dataset.
  * vehicle_length
  * vehicle_weight
  * ground_clearance
* Since the p-value is far below .05 (.0000000000535) the slope of the line is not zero.  Rejecting the null hypotheses.
* Due to the R-squared being 0.71 or 71% this linear model can be used to predict the MPG of the MechaCar prototypes, but could be improved upon.
